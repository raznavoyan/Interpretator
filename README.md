This is A little project for OOP exam.

First about integral data types:
    int = 4 bytes;
    double = 8 bytes;
    string = 8 bytes; // c++ std::string*
    char = 1;

but all variables will saved with void* in symtab map

If declare some varible with integer also you cane initialize to othr datatype like: 
"
    val a = 9\
    a = "hello"\

"
You cane make variable val NAME and you need geve value.
NAME can't be a keyword, contains alny latin characters and numbers, but it cane strat anly with  latin charecter.

End of line mark with '\'.
